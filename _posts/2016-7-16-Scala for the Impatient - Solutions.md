title: Scala for the Impatient - Solutions
---

As I try to get better at the Scala Programming Language(and functional programming).I'm going to post the solutions to Cay S. Horstmann's excellent book - [](http://horstmann.com/scala/) Scala for the Impatient. Do consider buying it if you are looking to learn Scala(with previous coding experience)
[](http://www.scala-lang.org/)
