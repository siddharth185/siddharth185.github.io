title: Scala for the Impatient - Solutions
---

As I try to get better at the [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/)  Programming Language(and functional programming).I'm going to post the solutions to Cay S. Horstmann's excellent book - [Scala for the Impatient](http://horstmann.com/scala/) . Do consider buying it if you are looking to learn (with previous coding experience)
